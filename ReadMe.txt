Programming Assignment No. 1 CS4793
Due: 09/25/2020

I use A* search to implement Best-first and Lowest-cost-first search, in one, on the search problem of acyclic robot delivery problem.
Run PA1.py for all paths expanded.

Run searchTest.py to see paths in A* and A* with multiple-path pruning
Result is a total cost of 41 going from o103 --> o109 --> o119 --> o123 --> r123
A* shows 16 paths expanded and 5 left on frontier when goal is found
A* with MPP shows 14 paths expanded and 4 paths left on frontier
